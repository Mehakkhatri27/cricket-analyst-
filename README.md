This project utilizes cricket data analysis to evaluate player performances and select the best XI players in the world. The process involves collecting data from ESPN Cricinfo, cleaning, transforming, and modeling the data using Python, Power Query, and DAX, and finally visualizing insights through a dashboard built in Power BI.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection** 📊: Data is collected from ESPN Cricinfo website using web scraping techniques.
2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation** 🧹: Python and Pandas are used to clean and transform the collected data.
3. **Data Modeling** 🛠️: Power Query is utilized for further data transformation and shaping.
4. **Parameterization** 📝: Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) is employed for data modeling and building parameters.
5. **Dashboard Creation** 📊: A dashboard is built in Power BI to visualize various metrics and insights derived from the data.
6. **Player Selection** 🏏: Insights gathered from the dashboard are used to select the final XI players based on their performances.

## Repository Structure
- **`csv and json`**: Contains the collected and transformed datasets.
- **`ipynb`**: Includes Python scripts for data collection, cleaning, and transformation.
- **`xlsx`**: Includes DAX scripts for data modeling and parameterization.
- **`pbix`**: Contains the Power BI dashboard file.

## Usage
- To interact with the dashboard, simply download the PBIX file available in the repository and open it using Power BI Desktop on your local machine. This will enable you to explore and interact with the dashboard, allowing for a seamless analysis of the cricket data.
